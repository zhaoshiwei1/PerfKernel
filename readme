Trying to develop out a simple performance test kernel with:
1, RPS mode, customized from web.
2, Basic and in-timely statistics presenting via web.

1, Merging statistic model from locust project.
2, Complete http utils; once request succeed or failed, added to relevant statistic entry via events listener automatically.

1, Complete token bucket, now attacking in rate.
2, Adding gevent in loop needs more investigation.

2020-08-05
1, Token bucket demo is done, now attacking can be in rps rate.
2, Attacking now is under non-blocked mode, with determined concurrency rate.
3, Statistics from locust now is working, with Hook function.(See RequestEntry and RequestStats)

1, Coroutine is running with in epoll event loop, once running, current application will be blocked.
2, Using coroutine to manage each attack
3, Using Thread to fill each CPU core
4, Using multiprocessing to fill processors.
5, Using the resource pool as a cloud-service.
